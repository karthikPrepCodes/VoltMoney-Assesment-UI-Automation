# VoltMoney — Playwright Automation
> Automated UI tests for the VoltMoney **Check Loan Eligibility** flow using Playwright (JavaScript)

### 🔹 Key Highlights
- **Page Object Model (POM)** — Each page is modularized into reusable objects and functions.
- **Utilities Layer** — Common helpers for element actions and generic functions.
- **Data-Driven Tests** — JSON files provide input data for test cases.
